                                The Raspberry Pi Foundation on Wednesday launched the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.

                                New Raspberry Pi Packs More Power
                                The new release comes two years after the introduction of its predecessor, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

                                The Raspberry Pi computer runs the open source Raspbian operating system.

                                The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is an incremental upgrade to a line of predecessors that have become entrenched in education, hobbyist and industry markets.

                                "The initial production run was only 10,000 boards," noted Simon Ritter, deputy CTO of Azul Systems.

                                "The Raspberry Pi, having sold in excess of 15 million boards, is now the world's third best-selling computer. Only the Windows PC and Mac have sold more," he told LinuxInsider.

                                Pi 3 Model B+ offers substantial system improvements.

                                Its 64-bit 1.4-GHz quad-core Broadcom Arm Cortex A53-architecture processor replaces the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B's 1.2-GHz CPU.
